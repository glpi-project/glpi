# GLPI docker devcontainers

The docker devcontainers are meant to be used by VSCode or in a Github Codespaces environment.

See the main `README.md` file in the `../.docker` folder.

If you need to customize the values from `devcontainer.json`, you can copy it to a subfolder of `.devcontainer`.  
Code will then ask you which file to use when starting the devcontainer.  
I suggest the `custom` folder as it is already git-ignored but you can use any name.
