<h2><A NAME="invent"></A>1 - Inventory Section</h2>

<h3><A NAME="inventa"></A>a) General informations</h3>
<p>In the inventory part you can list and consult the hardware and software inventory park. </p>

<p>You are able to perform parameterized and sorted researches on one of the types of the inventory (computers, networks, printers, monitors, cartridges, peripherals and softwares).</p>
<p>Here, you can post the form containing precise information of each indexed item, or add an item.</p>
<p>You have then the possibility to modify or delete each item.</p>
<p>Inside each kind of forms (computers, printers etc.), tabs are available to sorts the informations to be more clear and readable. You can chose the "ALL" tab to see all the availables informations.</p>
<p>The tabs <i><<</i> & <i>>></i> let you browse between the differents items of your inventory (Using the ID as condition).</p>

<h3><A NAME="inventb"></A>b) Templates Management</h3>
<p>You can define models of each type of items in your park, this allowing you to add several similar items very easily.</p>

<h3><A NAME="inventc"></A>c) Management of the computers internals devices</h3>
<p>Since GLPI 0.5, the notion of internal devices has appear. This let you add as much devices as you need in a computer.</p>
<p>You can manage the list of all the internal devices of your park in the Setup/Internal devices section.</p>
<p>Some internal devices type let you specify some specifics informations such as the hardware capacity.</p>

<h3><A NAME="inventd"></A>d) Management of the direct connections</h3>
<p>The direct connections make it possible to model the relation between the central processing unit of a computer and external components.</p>
<p>A direct connection is done between a computer and a printer, a monitor or an external device.</p>
<p>The connections or disconnections are done since the form of a computer or that of the dependent material.</p>

<h3><A NAME="invente"></A>e) Management of the networking ports</h3>
<p>A port network makes it possible to model a network interface on a given material.</p>
<p>Each port has an IP address, a mac address and a nework point to which it is connected.</p>
<p>The network connections are done by connecting two ports. To connect two materials together they must have an available port.</p>
<p>In most of the configurations, the connections will be done between a networking port on a computer, a screen or a printer and a networking port on a network material (hub, switch)</p>
<p>When connecting two materials, informations such as the IP address and the network point are updated for both of the ports</p>
<p>For each material, it is possible to add one or several ports </p>

<h3><A NAME="inventf"></A>f) Management of the softwares</h3>
<p>A software can have several licences having each one an associated serial and an end date</p>
<p>The installation of a software is done since the formsheet of a computer. </p>
<p>Each time that a software is installed, the number of licence available for this software decreases.</p>
<p>It is impossible to install a software, when no licence is available.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is possible to indicate the keyword "free" as serial when you add a new licence to a software. This license is installable without worrying about the number of the licenses.</p>
<p>its also possible to use the keyword "Global" when you are using a global licence your entire park.</p>
<p>It is possible to add several licences in one time. The serial and the end date will be the same one for each license added.</p>

</ul>

<h2><A NAME="admin"></A>5 - Administration Section</h2>

<h3><A NAME="admina"></A>a) Users Management</h3>
<p>This part works exactly in the same way that the items of the inventory. You can add, modify and remove users.</p>

<h3><A NAME="adminb"></A>b) Setup</h3>
<UL>
<a name="adminb1"></a><h4>i) Dropdowns</h4>
<p>You can in this section completly modify the data included in the select lists for example for the locations and the processors.<p>
<p>Once selected the list that you want to modify you can add of the elements, modify them and remove them.<br>

<p>Here you can modify all the internals devices that you can add into computers.</p>

<a name="adminb3"></a><h4>iii) External authentifications</h4>
<p>The external authentifications enable you to use alternative sources of authentification. That avoids you having to add all the users manually.</p>
<p>The first solution is to use a mail server:<br>
- In the first part, you must to define the mail server you want to use. Please, to fill it correctly follow this link  <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.imap-open.php">php.net</a> which provide several examples.
Some exwmples : {localhost:110/pop3}, {localhost:993/imap/ssl}, {localhost:995/pop3/ssl/novalidate-cert}...<br>
- The second parameter defines the mail domain used which will be used automatically to fill the mail addresses of the new users. If the user is called <i>toto</i>, then, his mail address will be toto@mail_domain. 
</p>
<p>The second solution id to use an LDAP server or an Active Directory. For this configuration defer to corresponding documentation present on the <a target=_blank href="http://glpi.indepnet.org/article.php3?id_article=33">Web site of GLPI</A>.</p>

<a name="adminb4"></a><h4>iv) Email Followup</h4>
<p>This section enables you to activate the followup of the interventions by email. Data (Save/Restore)
If you activate this functionality, emails will be sent for the creation of a new intervention, the addition of each followup and the closing of the interventions.<br>
- You should fill the email address of the administrator and the email signature which will be added to each email send<br>
- The other options enable you to limit the emails sent. For each type of people you can activate or not the sending for the creation of an intervention, the addition of followups and the closing of an intervention.<br>
- The defined groups of people are: the administrator, all 'admin' or 'normal' users, the person in charge of the task and the caller of the intervention.<br>
- The caller will not receive an email if it do not activated the email followup when he request for the intervention.<br>
</p>

<a name="adminb5"></a><h4>v) General Configuration</h4>
<p>The general configuration of the application makes it possible to define certain parameters: <br>
- The installation path. <b>Caution !!</b> 
This path is detected automatically at the time of the installation or of the update, you should not need to modify it.<br>
- The log level.<br>
- The number of events to be posted corresponds to the number of lines of log present on the banner page of the central.<br>
- The time of conservation of the logs. <b>Caution!!</b> If you keep them a long time your table can contain lots of data.<br>
- Show the interventions at the login: to or not to see the active interventions on the banner page of the central.<br>
- Number of elements ti print by page (valid for all the lists of elements posted - Tracking, computers...)<br>
- Maximum number of characters for each elements of the list: reduce the size of the character strings to show in order to obtain a readable posting.<br>
- Allow anonymous tracking post (helpdesk.html): activate or not the anonymous requests for interventions via the helpdesk.html file.<br>
</p>

<a name="adminb6"></a><h4>vi) Document Type</h4>
<p>Within this section, you can add or modify the documents types authorized to be managed by GLPI.
The needed informations are :<br>
- The name of the document type.<br>
- The extention ex: .txt<br>
- the name of the icon file of the document. Place the icons files in this folder pics/icones under the GLPI path.<br>
- The MIME type if needed.<br>
- Authorization of download of this file type (yes or no).<br>
</p>
</UL>
<h3><A NAME="adminc"></A>c) Settings</h3>
<p>This section allows you to change your password, to define the default order used in the posting of the interventions and to define the language used. </p>

<h3><A NAME="admind"></A>d) Data (Backup/Restore)</h3>
<p>This zone allows you to create SQL safeguards of the database ("Dump SQL").</p>
<p>You can also remove the backup files, to restore them or to download SQL files.</p>
<p>You can also generate a XML safeguard of the database. ("Dump XML").</p>
