I recommend getting the eBook [Handling Time](https://sellfy.com/p/8gxZ) as it has a lot of example code to get started.  The quick and dirty:

- To use this plugin you must include jQuery (1.6+) and jQuery UI with datepicker (and optionally slider).
- Include timepicker-addon script located in the `dist` directory.
- now use timepicker with `$('#selector').datetimepicker()` or `$('#selector').timepicker()`.
