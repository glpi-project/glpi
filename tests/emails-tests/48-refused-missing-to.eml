Subject: Test email without To header that should be refused
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

This is a test email that should be refused because:
1. The sender is not a known user in GLPI
2. There is no To: header (only Cci if any)

This email should trigger the bug where 'to' field is NULL in glpi_notimportedemails.
